                <br>4.1.1 Comply with a court order or other legal process;

                <br>5.1 The security of Your Personal Information is important to Us. We follow generally accepted
                industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to Us, both during transmission and
                once We receive it. All information gathered on Our Website is securely stored within Our controlled
                database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is
                password-protected and is strictly limited.

                <br>5.2 Although We make best possible efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating
                environment that is not open to the public, You should understand that there is no such thing as
                complete security, and We do not guarantee that there will be no unintended disclosures of Your Personal
                Information. If We become aware that Your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy, We will use reasonable efforts to notify You of the nature and
                extent of such disclosure (to the extent We know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as
                permitted by law.

                <br><br><b>6. COOKIES</b>

                <br>6.1 To improve the responsiveness of the sites for Our Users, We may use “cookies”, or similar
                electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User
                Identification (User ID) to understand the User’s individual interests using the Identified Computer.
                Unless You voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), We will have no way of
                knowing who You are, even if We assign a cookie to Your computer. The only personal information a cookie
                can contain is information You supply. A cookie cannot read data off Your hard drive. Our advertisers
                may also assign their own cookies to Your browser (if You click on their ads), a process that We do not
                control.
